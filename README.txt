This Java algorithm lets us rotate two dimensoinal arrays, clockwise and anticlockwise. For demonstration purposes
the arrays contain shapes formed with characters and all the arrays are stored in their own separate class, so as to
be able to instantiate all of them through a single object instance. The functions printShape(String[][] arr) ,
rotateLeft(String[][] arr) , and rotateRight(String[][] arr) are created in their own class for the same reason. That way
only two object instances are needed making main(String[] args) more clear. Description of the functionality of the functions
can be found in the RotatorClass in the form of comments.
